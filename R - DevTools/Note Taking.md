The point of learning anything is to have impact on the world.  

What good is the knowledge you learn if nothing is done with it and your life eventually comes to an end?

In school we are taught learning and working are very separate things, that we should learn, learn, learn... then eventually after years do something with all that we have learned.

But why not do both at the same time? Learn in public as you work! The only thing preventing this for most people is their Ego/Pride. Worst case scenario you look silly on the internet to a bunch of people. Best case scenario, others come and help. They correct you, they join on a discussion, they help you grow.

This is the unspoken process that takes place for everything that come out of our mouth  
C - Capture
O - Organize
D - Distill
E - Express

Everyone follows this process either unconsciously or consciously and some people might be lacking in certain parts of it.

For instance:
- Some people might capture too much information or capture the wrong information.
- Others might be bad at organizing the information they gather. Be it in their head or written down
- Others might struggle to Distill, or make information handy for their future self. This could make reading an entire book feel really great but when youn  you need to use the info and you have to read the entire book again.
- And other might be bad at expressing the things that they have learned

Any one section of this process that is lacking can affect the entire throughput. And in turn make you not able to accurately convey information, be scatter brained, or be disorganized in general.
