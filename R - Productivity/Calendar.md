My Journey to max productivity

## Calendar apps

In the process of trying:
- [Vimcal](https://www.vimcal.com/)
	- Love the idea of being more personable than calendly
	- Not a huge fan of the mobile app so far
		- the vertical scrolling sometimes hides meetings

Have tried:
- [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) (used for years)
- [Apple Calendar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calendar/id1108185179)

Maybe worth checking out:
- [Cron](https://cron.com/)

## Scheduling Meetings

- [Vimcal](https://www.vimcal.com/)
- [Calendly](https://calendly.com/)
- [Cal](https://cal.com/)
	- open source alternative to calendly
