My Journey to max productivity

## Terminals

Tried and liked:
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) (previous terminal, much love)
	- profiles are really handy for ssh'ing into many machines
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) (trying now)
	- love it so far
	- power of a text editor in the terminal
		- multicursor
		- selecting text
	- loses features with tmux

Tried and didn't like:
- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)

## Additional

Currently using:
- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
- [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
